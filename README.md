# pwshF5DistributedCloud

This repository contains a PowerShell Module for interacting with the F5 Distributed Cloud REST API. It is currently in early development phase where initial functions are being developed.


All functions will be prefixed with "XC" after the relevant (standard) PowerShell verb. i.e.

`Get-XCNamespaces`  
`New-XCDNSZone`  
`Remove-XCDNSZone`
